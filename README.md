Project 2 at Metis  

Collect movie and box office data by web scraping [BoxOfficeMojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/) and then use linear regressions to predict the revenue of foreign films in US markets.  

You can read more about my process of web scraping the BoxOfficeMojo site in my [blog post on web scraping](http://trishaandrews.com/Web-Scraping/).

I ran a series of linear regression models to try to determine if a foreign/foreign language film's US gross could be determined from a variety of factors, including number of opening theaters, country of origin, and genre.  
Further information and results can be found in my [linear regression blog post](http://trishaandrews.com/Linear-Regressions/).
